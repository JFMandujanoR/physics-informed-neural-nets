## Abstract

This code is associated with the manuscript entitled, "Spatio-temporal ecological models via physics-informed neural net-
works for studying chronic wasting disease" by Reyes et al. It generates simulated data and demonstrates the application of a simple
physics-informed neural network. It is provided as Jupyter notebooks.
